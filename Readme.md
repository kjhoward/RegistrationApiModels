# RegistrationLoginApi Client 

This library project contains the required classes for use in client operations by the RegistrationLogin API and other APIs  for the "QueryResult" and "UserResource" classes for the RegistrationLoginApi project.

The idea of the Clients assembly is that it surfaces the business logic and authorization attributes from the core project allowing them to be used elsewhere and tested against external from the project. 

This project is a dependency of https://github.com/kjhoward/dotnet-5-registration-login-api
