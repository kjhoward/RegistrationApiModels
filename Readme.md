# RegistrationLoginApi Models 

This library project contains the required for the "QueryResult" and "UserResource" classes for the RegistrationLoginApi project.

The idea of the Models assembly is that it extracts your business models from the project allowing them to be used elsewhere and tested against external from the project. 

This project is a dependency of https://github.com/kjhoward/dotnet-5-registration-login-api
